### Hello, Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¤“
I am a highly creative individual with extensive knowledge of web and cloud infrastructure. My experience in startups, and shipping features in dynamic, agile environments, has made me a lifelong learner, always ready to embrace challenges, identify issues, and systematically develop solutions.

Before diving into web development, I was passionate about embedded systems, working on DIY projects with Arduino, ESP32, and similar technologies. Now my fascination with the cloud drives me to continually push my limits and expand my expertise every day.
